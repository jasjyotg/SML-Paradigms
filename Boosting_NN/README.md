# Boosting and Neural Networks for Classification

## Overview

This notebook explores and compares two powerful classification techniques:

- **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)**
- **Neural Networks (Multi-layer Perceptron - MLP)**

It provides insights into how boosting can improve weak learners, and how neural networks perform on structured data.

---

## Dataset

- A classification dataset is used, likely from `sklearn.datasets` (e.g., `make_classification`, `load_breast_cancer`, etc.).
- The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using `train_test_split`.

---

## Implemented Models

### 1. AdaBoost Classifier

- Ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners (e.g., decision stumps).
- Uses `AdaBoostClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`.
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `n_estimators`: Number of boosting rounds.
  - `base_estimator`: Typically a shallow decision tree.

- **Outputs**:
  - Training Accuracy
  - Test Accuracy

### 2. Neural Network Classifier

- Implemented using `MLPClassifier` from `sklearn.neural_network`.
- Trains a multi-layer feedforward neural network.
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `hidden_layer_sizes`: e.g., (100,), (50, 30)
  - `activation`: `relu`, `tanh`, etc.
  - `solver`: e.g., `adam`, `sgd`
  - `max_iter`: Number of training iterations

- **Outputs**:
  - Training Accuracy
  - Test Accuracy
  - Convergence behavior

---

## Evaluation

Both models are evaluated using:

- Accuracy on training and testing sets
- (Optionally) confusion matrix or classification report
- Performance comparison (speed, convergence, overfitting)

## Results Summary

| Model      | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Notes                          |
|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| AdaBoost   | High (Varies)  | Good          | Good with low-depth trees      |
| MLP        | Very High      | Goodâ€“Very Good| May overfit without tuning     |

> Results may vary based on the dataset, hyperparameters, and random seed.

---

## Conclusion

- **AdaBoost** is effective at improving simple models and reducing bias.
- **Neural Networks** are flexible and powerful, but require careful tuning to avoid overfitting.
- Each model has strengths depending on the data and context.
