# SML-Paradigms

## Overview

This repository contains a series of notebooks that explore various supervised machine learning techniques for classification. The goal is to understand, implement, and compare classical and ensemble learning methods using real-world and synthetic datasets.

### Covered Techniques:
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA/QDA)
- Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA)
- Decision Trees (DT)
- Bagging
- Random Forests (RF)
- Boosting (AdaBoost)
- Neural Networks (MLP)
